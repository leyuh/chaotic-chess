# Chaotic Chess (pronounced /ch/-aotic)

## An exciting version of chess like never seen before. Meet your characters:

### King - Elon Musk
  There is none more deserving of the title of King than the Musketeer himself. Protect him at all costs.
  
### Queen - Lex Fridman
  Like the queen, Lex Fridman gets stuff done. Also, he is a simp for Musk.
  
### Bishop - David Goggins
  Goggins moves fast and stealthily. You won't see him coming.
  
### Knight - Ben Shapiro
  Ben will knock down anyone in his path, because facts don't care about your feelings.
  
### Rook - Jordan Peterson
  Jordan is a straight-forward, hard-hitting guy.
  
### Pawn - Joe Rogan
  Joe is an essential asset (kind of). His height is the only thing in his way.
